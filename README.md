# What is it?

Hi, this is my LEGO MOC collection. I will share the selective LEGO brick lists here. 

# How to use?


To get the building guides and brick lists, you need to download the LDD (lego digital designer).

- [Windows](https://lc-www-live-s.legocdn.com/downloads/ldd2.0/installer/setupLDD-PC-4_3_10.exe)
- [MacOS](https://lc-www-live-s.legocdn.com/downloads/ldd2.0/installer/setupLDD-MAC-4_3_10.zip)

After that, open LXF file in LDD, click `Tool box` --> `generate building guide(ctrl+M)`, and then `View` --> `building guide mode(F7)`.

In building guide mode, you can download the instruction in html format, and open in browser. In the browser, you can further save the instruction into PDF.

# Build it!

To buy the bricks, you can visit [bricklink](https://bricklink.com) and [rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com).

To import LDD LXF into bricklink or rebrickable can make your life easier:
